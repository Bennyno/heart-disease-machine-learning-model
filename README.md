Predicting heart disease using machine learning
This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting wether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

Approach:

* Problem definition
* Data
* Evaluation
* Features
* Modelling
* Experimentation
* 
1. Problem Defintion
Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict wether or not they have heart disease?

2. Data
The original data came from the Cleveland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. There is also a version of it available in Kaggle.

3. Evaluation
If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting wether or not wether a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll pursue the project.
